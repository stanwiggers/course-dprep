# Syllabus


## Learning objectives

Data sets (e.g., retrieved from a company's database, collected via surveys, or
scraped from the Internet) need to undergo a careful cleaning and transformation
procedure before they can be used in empirical research projects [^1]. Therefore, in this course, you familiarize yourself with data structures common in empirical marketing research, and learn how to efficiently engineer complex data sets and document
them for reusability/reproducibility.

[^1]: For example, see the data sections in these papers: [Building a user panel of music consumption from Spotify](http://tiu.nu/spotify), [Preparing a panel data set on electronics sales and marketing mix activities across thousands of brands](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/publications/universality-or-differences-in-marketing-elasticities-in-emerging).

After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

- Use R to read in various data formats for further processing
- Apply common data operations in R to transform and clean your data (e.g., aggregation, merging, de-duplication, reshaping, date conversions, regular expressions)
- Use basic programming concepts to increase speed and minimize errors (e.g., looping, vectorization, writing functions, handling errors/debugging)
- Operationalize variables/engineer features from numerical, textual, and visual raw data
- Store and manage data using file-based systems and databases
- Use workflow management techniques to create and audit automated and reproducible data pipelines
- Version code and manage and contribute to GitHub repositories
- Document and archive final data sets, and learn how to make them available for public (re)use

<!--  - Project management on GitHub (versioning, issue management, collaboration)
<!-- plugin R for using Git -->
<!--  - Advanced file I/O: Data formats (e.g., CSV, JSON), systems (e.g., file-based, structured and unstructured databases), and local vs. remote architectures-->
<!--  - Data pipelines
  - Automation using `make`
  - Command-line scripting
--><!-- by producing log files and diagnostic tables and figures
<!--      - Logging into audit txt files
      - Generation of Latex and Word output
      - Report preparation in latex/Overleaf

      - Assess data quality by means of log files and automatically generated tables and figures

(e.g., command-line scripting, automation using `make`)


- Store and manage structured and unstructured data in file-based systems and databases


structured (e.g., CSV, XLSX) and unstructured (e.g., JSON) raw data from multiple sources (e.g., files, databases) for further processing

's `data.table` and `dplyr`


<!--panel data vs cross sectioneel; pair-wise; unit-of-analysis -->

<!-- exercises suggested by roy:

1) this is what i want as an output; this is the input. Do it
2) this is code that doesn't work; fix it so that I can get what I want to get.


-->
<!-- Basic R:
- load packages
- ...
-->

<!--  - Externally (EC2, launching instances, manage HPC code)
Work on VMs on AWS, code in SQL and R, compete on Kaggle, or work on own computer--; Coding Dojo student-=led analysis; while sharing screens-->
<!--
  - Logging/monitoring
    - Dynamic output:
      - Shiny
      - NodeJS/dynamic graphs
--><!--, work on virtual machines on AWS EC2, and write basic code in SQL-->

<!--, MySQL, MongoDB and Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 and S3-->

## Grading

- Group project (4-5 team members) with self- and peer assessment (see below) (40%)
<!-- submitted as a GitHub repository (during the course); building a dataset-->
- Computer exam (60%)


Students pass this course if the final course grade (i.e., the weighted average of the group project and exam; weights indicated above) is ≥ 5.5, and the exam is passed (≥ 5.5).

### Team project

Students will submit a final team project at the end of the course.

Students' individual grades will be corrected upwards or downwards, depending on
- their individual contribution to the overall team effort (measured by means of scoring themselves and their team members on, among others, the quantity and quality of their contributions),
- whether they have provided written feedback to team members at least once during the course, and
- students' individual investment in developing the technical skills required to contribute meaningfully to the project (measured by means of students' individual submissions of answers to the tutorials/data challenges).

<!-- submitted as a GitHub repository (during the course); building a dataset-->
<!--[or, take-home exam?] (can do 40%?) with a passing threshold?-->
<!--
- Share progress and learnings (e.g., open science contributions in the form of course-relevant contributions in the form of pull requests to GitHub, maintaining a public FAQ/blog, sharing one's progress with the group) (20%) [[[???]]]
-->

## Format

- Hybrid format: R notebooks or lessons on Datacamp.com for preparation and self-paced lab sessions; live streams for feedback and joint coding sessions (recordings will be made available)
- Modern content: copy-paste code snippets and demos from the course page, access code on GitHub, start projects with workflow templates
- Interactive, immersive and student-centred: live coding, hackathon, working with real data sets <!--debates, -->

<!--, simulations, hackathon-->
<!-- work on VMs on AWS, code in SQL and R, compete on Kaggle, or work on own computer--; Coding Dojo student-=led analysis; while sharing screens-->

## Student profile / prerequisites

- The course is instructed to MSc students in the Marketing Analytics (TiSEM) program.
- The course expects students to have acquired working knowledge in R (e.g., from introductory courses at Datacamp).
- The course welcomes novices, of whom extra preparation prior to the start of the course is expected. Preparation material will be shared with students in advance in the form of R Notebooks or course recommendations at Datacamp. Novices may further benefit from following other courses at Tilburg University in which R is used.
- Students are recommended to use their own computer for this course (Windows, Mac or Linux). Android/Chromebook/iOS devices are not supported. Moreover, we highly recommend a computer with at least 8 GBs of RAM memory as we'll work with large data sets that require significant preprocessing. 


## Enrollment and Obtaining Course Credits
